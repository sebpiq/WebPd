# Planned features v1.0.0

游린 = not planned and might never be implemented
游릲 = planned for v1.0.0 but not done yet
游릴 = done

游릴 **Sending messages to the patch (messageReceivers).** 

游릴 **Receiving messages from the patch (messageSenders).** 

游릲 **Box with just number inside as a shortcut for float.** 

For now, use the full `[float 8]` instead of `[8]`.

游릲 **Unpacking a list to inlets of an object.** 

As a hidden feature, some objects like `[\]` support a list instead of having to send a separate message to their inlets. 

For now, instead of :

```
   [1 4(
    |
   [ \ ] -> will send 0.25
```

use :

```
    [t b b]
     /   \
   [1(  [4(
    |  /
   [ \ ]
```

游린 **Data structures.**

游린 **GEM.**

NOTE : some of these objects, such as `[openpanel]` are no-ops since they are UI objects.
